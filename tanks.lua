-- This program was written by Franciszek Jemio≈Ço

-- We have to hold a variable for population, a list of gene invetions so that
-- the invention number does not grow too big.
-- In the population we have to create an ordered list of species / by fitness
-- and by structure (when creating new population).
-- We start with uniform population of one species that has no hidden nodes
-- mutateConnections - add one new connection - this is an invetion so has to be
-- kept there and we have to look if it isn't there when creating new.
-- mutateNodes - actually it just adds two connection as an invetion so we 
-- also have to check there to see if it isn't already there, and only then
-- assign new number to it.
-- We probably have to go through the invetions and after that choose a random
-- values that are not already in inventions.
-- This piece of magic requires torch for the tensor library so it will be
-- easy to handle tensor and matrix operations
-- Mutations only occur between input and output layer! (output is not mutated)
require('torch')
